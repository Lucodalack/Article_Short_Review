There r many factors in optimize launch times.

In a part of launch time: . Dyld is Apple’s program responsible for getting an app ready to use. It runs in the same process as the code you write and starts by loading all dependent frameworks¹, including any system frameworks.

Part of dyld’s job is “rebasing” pointers in binary metadata that describe types in your source code

ObjC code has a lot of metadata need to rebase. Swift class also has objc meta data too.
Value type don't have objc meta data -> decrease rebase time but increase file size.

=> Pick type wisely, value type or class type.
Avoid create many type.
