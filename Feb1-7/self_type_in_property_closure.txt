In class, when use property initializer by closure.
In this closure, self is not the object instant but have another type. Be aware.
class MyTableCell: UITableViewCell {
let button: UIButton = {
        let button = UIButton()
        button.setTitle("Title", for: .normal)
        button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(didTapButton(_:)), for: .touchUpInside)
        return button
    }()
}
This code won't work, the button event click will not fired when user click on button. Cz the self when add target in closure is not tableViewCell.
Why? 
In swift self will be initialize when all its property initial. So in the time button initial, self has not created yet. And self in this close sure have type: (MyTableCell) -> () -> MyTableCell, a reflect of -[NSObject self]
