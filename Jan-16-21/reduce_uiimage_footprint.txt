Note:
When show an UIImage, the memory usage != file_size. The memory usage reflected with the image dimension. Example
A sample image has 3648px × 5472px has:
(3648 * 5472) * 4 bytes ≈ 80MB .

Reduce mem: resize a UIImage won't help cz resize a UIImage is expensive and it's also require the image is loaded.
We need to Downsampling image use ImageIO.
Use function CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex to downsampling image to a specific scale.
