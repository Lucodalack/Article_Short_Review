Usually we use ui test for feature testing. But we could also use XCTest for feature test.
ST we need to use.
Sending a ui event by: controller.toggleTextButton.sendActions(for: .touchUpInside)
Need to load view: loadViewIfNeeded()
Test vc push: check navigation.viewcontrollers

But with my opinion this way is not good, we should use a UITest for fully control the feature test and could build a auto-test for init
