Today is my first start article in this reading challenge
This is a short review about a article i've just read in the Newyork Time
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/google-larry-page-sergey-br.html

Larry Page and Sergey Brin is 2 founders of Google
After founded GG 21 years ago, Larry Page has runned GG for a short time.
But actuall they didnt have much experiences for running a company
so the investors required a another person who was ready to run a company.
After that  Eric Schmidt was choosed

the 2 founder didnt have much interested in management, they still suitable for playing professor role in a lab
So they really want to spend their time to do innovation, challege things.

After had leaved CEo role, they invested to many others project, some of this is AI, self driving car and etc
also have some fiction project like space elevator, teleport... something just insane and dont bring back any revenue

They back to be a CEO once after that, but soon got bored with the repeat works when running a company 
and leave it later.

althought they dont pay much concentration in running a company they still have 51 percent of stock of Alphabet.
