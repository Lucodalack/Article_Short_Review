This is a key goals system to improve employee ability
In this method: we have to list 3-5 goals to do in a period of time
Goal should be have high hard level so we can try hard to reach that
Goals should be measurable
The target spot is 60-70% lower is we didn't try enough or the goals is too much
If we got the better result, we need to re-consider about the goals, may be it's too easy
The OKR have to be public and transparent
