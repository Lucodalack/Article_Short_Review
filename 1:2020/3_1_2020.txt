I'm really like this article
The main topic is about randomness and the happenable of a independent event
A independent event is a event that happen without any relevant with the past result
So we can't predict the next result by analyst the old data

There 3 case of a prediction:
White noise: the true randomness - we have no idea about what'll happen next because this is a independent event and unpredictable 
Red noise: pessimistic side - the thing happen frequently more than normal will happen less frequently in the future 
Blue noise: optimistic side - the thing happen frequently in the past will keep happen in that way and event more
