Today article is about collectionForOne
I usually see thing like
A += [b]
But it's really bad with me, why we just not use append
But in this case we could use CollectonforOne instead, this have a better performance than operator but still worse than append
So it's not a best use case
But it's is a really good option for some func require a param as a collection
TIL
